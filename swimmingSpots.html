        Outdoor Swimming Spots in Zurich

                <p>One of Zürichs best features is the huge number of possibilities for swimming in the lake, river and numerous outdoor pools (Badis), and these are a few of my favourites.</p>
                <p>June to September are the main swimming months when the water is generally 20C/68F and above. May and October are definitely a bit colder, but it depends on the year. This website will show you the <a href="https://www.badi-info.ch/_temp/zuerichsee-temperatur.htm">current water temperatures</a></p>

                <h2>1. Badi Letzigraben</h2>
                <p class="price"><strong>Price: </strong>8Fr</p>
                <p>Just about 100 meters from my apartment, Badi Letzigraben is my go-to spot for a swim. With its Olympic-sized pool, wave pool, and sunbathing areas, it’s a really great place to relax</p>

                <h2>2. Saffa-Insel</h2>
                <p class="price"><strong>Price: </strong>Free</p>
                <p>Saffa Island is a serene little island near Landiwiese. It's ideal for sunbathing on the grass and swimming in the lake, and generally has very few people. It's about a 20 minute walk from the top of the lake, or you can take bus 161 or 165 to Landiewiese</p>

                <h2>3. Flussbad Oberer Letten</h2>
                <p class="price"><strong>Price: </strong>Free</p>
                <p>For a more lively swimming experience, Oberer Letten on the river is a great option. In good weather it will be crowded with locals sunbathing, listening to music, playing beach volleyball and floating down the river. A good option is to walk upstream to the Dynamo Cafe, then jump in and float down to Letten again with the current. There's a bar at Oberer Letten, and if you walk downstream there a few more bars and cafes. Definitely more urban style (decaying concrete, graffiti etc) than pretty pretty, but a very local spot that's worth a visit</p>
                <p><strong>SAFETY WARNING:</strong> Be sure to exit by the end of the platforms, as there are waterworks further down (if in doubt, watch what the locals do)</p>

                <h2>4. Werdinsel</h2>
                <p class="price"><strong>Price: </strong>Free</p>
                <p>Werdinsel is a more tranquil option for river swimming. Perfect for a picnic or a leisurely afternoon under the trees. The upstream end of the island is generally busier, especially on very sunny days, and offers food and drinks. Clothing is optional at the downstream end, so don't be surprised if you run into a few naked locals!</p>
                <p><strong>SAFETY WARNING:</strong>When swimming on the north side of the island (pictured), be sure to exit by the large sign and steps, as there are waterworks further down (again, if in doubt, watch what the locals do)</p>

                <p>Seebad Utoquai is a historic bathhouse on the lake very close to the center of the city</p>

                <p class="price"><strong>Price: </strong>Sometimes 8Fr, sometimes free. I'm not sure there is a system</p>
                <p>Seebad Enge is a floating bar, cafe, pool, and swimming spot. It’s a great place to enjoy the views of the city and lake, and sometimes the Alps are also visible to the south. On around 10 sunday nights during the summer they offer free concerts which are definitely recommended - music can be quite varied, but the atmosphere is always nice.

                <p class="price"><strong>Price: </strong>Free</p>
                <p>Rentenwiese is a popular sunbathing spot in a lovely park right in the middle of the city. How busy it is depends a lot on the day and weather - on a sunny weekend, it will be pretty crowded with locals grilling, sunbathing and playing music, but a lot of the time is fairly empty. It also provides direct access to the lake for swimming</p>

                <p class="price"><strong>Price: </strong>8Fr</p>
                <p>One of the few sandy beaches in the city (although to be honest I prefer to lie on the grass). Strandbad Mythenquai is a very nice park and a favorite for families. Offers stand up paddles for rent, and has a nice restaurant</p>

                <p>Frauenbadi is a historic women-only bathhouse on the River, offers a unique swimming experience. At night it turns into a relaxed bar, and men are also allowed</p>

                <p class="price"><strong>Price: </strong>Free</p>
                <p>Zürichhorn is a picturesque lakeside park and the best way to get there is by simply walking down the lakeside from Bellevue. For swimming, you can sneak in through the trees for a quick dip in the lake waters, or there's a small beach towards the south near the large sculpture. Probably has the most open park area around the lake, so there's space to play football, frisbee etc.</p>
