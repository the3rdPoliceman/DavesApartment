                <p>There's a shared washing machine in the washing room in the basement of the building </p>
                <p>To find it, go down the stairs until you can't go any further. Then go through the green door to the left, and you'll find the washing room at the end on the left. If the green door is locked, the apartment key will open it. There's a light switch just after you go through the green door</p>

                <div class="basics-section-title script">What do i need to know?</div>
                <ul class="basics-list">
                    <li>The machine takes 20c or 1 franc coins. 80c will get you a bit more than an hour, which is enough for most washes (you can see the wash time on the machine when you select the program)</li>
                    <li>Sometimes people turn the power off at the wall. If there's no lights on the coin box, use the weird turning switch on the wall to the left of the coin box to turn it on</li>
                    <li>There's washing powder in the tall cupboard in the kitchen, and a small brown purse with some coins</li>
                </ul>

            <div class=" col-md-6 col-12">
                <div class="basics-section-title script">Any Rules?</div>
                <ul class="basics-list">
                	<li>Washing is only allowed between 8am and 10pm</li>
                    <li>There's no reservation system - if it's free, you can use it. Well ok, that's not totally true - if people have left bags of washing near the machine, that is kind of a queue</li>
                    <li>Please take your washing out when it finishes</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class=" col-md-6 col-12">
                <div class="basics-section-title script">What about drying?</div>
                <ul class="basics-list">
                    <li>You can use the drying room in the basement (behind the huge wooden door), or the dryer in the apartment</li>
                    <li>Your clothes will dry in about 24hrs in the drying room. Click the 1 button to turn on the dehydrator and select level 3</li>
                    <li>When using the dryer in the apartment, I suggest using one of the Schranktrocken (cupboard dry) settings. Choose Schranktrocken on the right for normal temperature, or the one on the left for lower temperature. Also note, it's a condenser dryer, so please pull out and empty the water drawer at the top left before using </li>
